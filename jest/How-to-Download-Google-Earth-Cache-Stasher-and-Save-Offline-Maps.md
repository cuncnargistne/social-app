Google Earth Cache Stasher is a script that allows you to manage Google Earth's image cache files. As you browse locations normally in Google Earth, the images are saved to a backup file in Google Earth's working directory, up to a maximum of 2GB. The problem is when the 2GB limit is reached, the oldest images are discarded to make room for the new ones. This limits the amount of offline data you can view when there is no internet connection available.
 
The solution is to make backups with Google Earth Cache Stasher. You can create backups anytime you want, name them anything you want and restore them any time you want. This way, you can save offline maps of your favorite places and access them whenever you need them.

## How to Use Google Earth Cache Stasher
 
To use Google Earth Cache Stasher, you need to have Google Earth installed on your computer. You can download Google Earth from [here](https://earth.google.com/download/).

Once you have everything ready, you can run Google Earth Cache Stasher and follow these steps:
 
1. Click on "Default Backup" to make a backup of your current image cache files. This will empty your current cache and create a folder named "default" in your Google Earth Cache Stasher directory.
2. Open Google Earth and zoom in and around the location you'd like to archive (your hometown, for example). This will start filling your newly emptied cache with new images from that location.
3. When you are satisfied you have covered enough area for your archive, go back to Google Earth Cache Stasher and click on "Create New Stash". Enter a name for your stash (your hometown, again for example) and click OK. This will create a folder with your stash name in your Google Earth Cache Stasher directory.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for any other locations you want to save offline.
5. To restore a stash, simply click on "Restore Stash" and select the stash name from the list. This will overwrite your current cache with the images from the selected stash.
