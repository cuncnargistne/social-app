1. Download the crack fix from a reliable source. You can try searching for "Call of Duty: Ghosts v1.0 All No-DVD [Reloaded]" on MegaGames[^1^] [^2^], which is one of the most popular sites for game fixes. Make sure you scan the file with an antivirus before opening it.
2. Unrar the file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should see a folder called "Crack" that contains several files.
3. Burn or mount the image file called "rld-codghosts.iso" using a program like Daemon Tools or PowerISO. This will create a virtual drive on your computer that contains the game files.
4. Install the game by running the setup.exe file from the virtual drive. Follow the instructions on the screen and choose a destination folder for the game.
5. Copy over the cracked content from the "Crack" folder to your game install directory. This will replace some of the original files with modified ones that can bypass the Steam protection.
6. Play the game by running the iw6sp64\_ship.exe file from your game install directory. You should be able to enjoy Call of Duty Ghosts without any problems.

Note: This crack fix only works for version 1.0 of the game. If you want to update your game to a newer version, you will need to download another crack fix that matches the version number. For example, if you want to update your game to version 1.4, you will need to download "Call of Duty: Ghosts v1.4 All No-DVD [Reloaded]" from MegaGames[^3^] and repeat steps 5 and 6.
 
We hope this article was helpful for you. However, we remind you once again that downloading and using a crack fix is illegal and risky, and we do not support or encourage this practice in any way. If you want to play Call of Duty Ghosts legally and safely, please buy the game from Steam or other authorized platforms.

Call of Duty Ghosts is a first-person shooter game that was released in 2013 by Activision. It is the tenth installment in the Call of Duty series and the sixth developed by Infinity Ward. The game is set in a near future where a cataclysmic event has altered the global balance of power and a group of elite soldiers known as Ghosts fight against a new enemy that threatens the remnants of America.
 
The game features a single-player campaign that follows the story of Logan Walker, a member of the Ghosts who tries to stop the Federation, a coalition of South American countries that has invaded the United States. The game also features a multiplayer mode that allows players to compete against each other in various modes and maps. Additionally, the game introduces a new mode called Extinction, where players cooperate to fight against alien creatures that have invaded Earth.
 
Call of Duty Ghosts received mixed reviews from critics and fans. Some praised the game for its graphics, gameplay, and Extinction mode, while others criticized it for its story, characters, and lack of innovation. The game was also criticized for its technical issues and bugs, which prompted the release of several patches and updates to fix them. The game sold well commercially, but not as well as previous Call of Duty games.
