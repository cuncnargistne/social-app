To use Nikon Camera Control Pro 2.9, you need a serial number key that is provided when you purchase the software. The serial number key is a 20-digit alphanumeric code that you need to enter when you install the software or when you update it to a newer version[^3^]. The serial number key is unique to each user and cannot be shared or transferred to others.
 
If you have lost or forgotten your serial number key, you can contact Nikon customer support and provide them with your proof of purchase and your camera model and serial number. They will verify your information and send you a new serial number key by email. Alternatively, you can use a third-party tool that can generate a valid serial number key for your camera model[^3^]. However, this is not recommended as it may violate the terms and conditions of Nikon and cause problems with your software or camera.
 
Nikon Camera Control Pro 2.9 is a powerful and convenient software that can enhance your photography experience and workflow. By using the serial number key, you can unlock all the features and functions of the software and control your Nikon DSLR remotely.
  
To start Camera Control Pro 2.9, you can launch it from your desktop icon or from the Start menu. Alternatively, you can launch it from ViewNX-i, a software that allows you to view and edit your images and movies[^1^]. To do this, select [Launch Camera Control Pro 2] from the [File] menu in ViewNX-i[^1^]. Make sure that Nikon Transfer 2 is not running when you start Camera Control Pro 2.9.
 
Once Camera Control Pro 2.9 is running, you need to connect your camera to your computer. You can use a USB cable or a wireless transmitter, depending on your camera model and preference[^2^]. If you use a wireless transmitter, you need to set up the wireless LAN connection between your camera and your computer. Refer to the user manual of your wireless transmitter for details.
 
After connecting your camera, you can see the camera settings and status on the Camera Control Pro 2.9 window. You can change any of the settings by clicking on them and selecting the desired option from the drop-down menu or by entering a value directly[^2^]. You can also use the buttons on the toolbar to access some common functions, such as live view, shutter release, exposure compensation, and bracketing[^2^]. You can also customize the toolbar by adding or removing buttons according to your needs.
 
To view the live view image from your camera, click on the [LV] button on the toolbar or select [Start Live View] from the [Camera] menu[^2^]. The live view image will appear on a separate window, where you can adjust the focus point by clicking on the image or by using the arrow keys on your keyboard[^2^]. You can also zoom in or out by using the slider or the mouse wheel[^2^]. To capture an image while in live view mode, click on the [S] button on the toolbar or press the [Enter] key on your keyboard[^2^]. The image will be saved to your computer and optionally to your camera memory card as well.
 
To download images from your camera to your computer, click on the [Download] button on the toolbar or select [Download Selected Images] from the [Camera] menu[^2^]. You can select which images to download by checking or unchecking them on the Camera Control Pro 2.9 window. You can also specify the destination folder and file name format for the downloaded images in the preferences dialog[^2^]. If you have ViewNX-i installed, you can set it to automatically show the downloaded images by selecting [Show Image Immediately After Shooting] from the [File] menu in ViewNX-i[^1^].
